		   				Bauxite is the ore from which humans obtain the metal known as aluminium. Aluminium (chemical symbol <code>Al</code>) is a major material used in manufacturing these days, mainly in transport vehicles such as cars, bicycles, and aeroplanes. It is found mainly in low-silica <mark><em>igneous rocks</em></mark>, but also in clay and limestone.

		   				The mineral we obtain from mining coal is simply coal, as it does not need to be processed in any way to be useful to us. Made mainly from carbon (chemical symbol <code>C</code>), it is formed from the compacted remains of carbon-based lifeforms that existed and died millions of years ago. We use it mainly as a power source around the world, but in Australia we primarily export it, as sustainability has become a prioritised focus of our environment. Coal is usually found in <mark><em>sedimentary rocks</em></mark>, near large fossil deposits, as the owners of the fossils usually supplied the decomposed tissue coal is composed of.

		   				Gold (chemical symbol <code>Au</code>) is useful to humans in various ways after it has been mined, cleansed, cut and polished. It is used mainly for jewellery purposes, but as an extremely efficient and long-lasting conductor of heat and electricity, gold is also used in technology &mdash; you can find gold in the circuitry of nearly any computer, phone, or tablet you see. Gold is nearly always found in <mark><em>igneous rocks</em></mark>, either from being formed around by magma, or from erosion of metamorphic, sedimentary, or other igneous rocks.

		   				Haematite is the mineral in which we find the greatest quantities of iron (chemical symbol <code>Fe</code>). Iron is used today mainly combined with carbon to create steel, one of the strongest and most versatile metals in use around the world today. Used mainly in construction, steel can be used in a building in many ways, most prominently and frequently used, however, is a grid of steel which cement is poured over to form reinforced concrete. Tonnes of reinforced concrete is used each day for various buildings around the world. Haematite is most commonly found in <mark><em>sedimentary rocks</em></mark>.

		<h3 class="text-center">How Ore Forms</h3>

		<p>

			Minerals are formed when they are concentrated by hydrothermal waters, and rise to the surface of the Earth's mantle (where most of the magma is &mdash; just underneath the crust) where they are jettisoned into cooling magma which forms igneous rock, and then follows the path of the rock cycle to form either sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous rocks.

		<h3 class="text-center">What Else is Found?</h3>

		<p>

			Minerals are far from being the only thing mined from ores. Other things mined from ores include oil and petroleum, jewels, salt, and other metals including silver, copper, and zinc.

		<h3 class="text-center">How Minerals are Extracted</h3>

		<p>

			Some minerals, such as gold and coal, don't need to be extracted &mdash; they are used without any processing. The other minerals, however, need to be extracted in a certain way. First, the rocks are crushed, then placed in a pool of water and crushed and mixed further. The heavy metal sinks to the bottom &mdash; this is taken away for processing. Sometimes, however, microscopic specks remain in the water, and although it might not sound like much, over a long time it accounts to a lot of money lost for the mining company. To fix this, the water is then sprinkled with particles that are attracted to the metals, and also float. Then the microscopic particles float up to the top, and are scraped off and cleansed.
